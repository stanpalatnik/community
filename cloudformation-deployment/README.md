# Open Distro for Elasticsearch CloudFormation Templates

These templates create a full Open Distro for Elasticsearch deployment, including secure networking provided through VPC, configurable data nodes, master  nodes and a client node. The client node provides Kibana access with a public IP  address.

## Template descriptions

The deployment uses CloudFormation's [nested stacks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-nested-stacks.html) to deploy a number of sub stacks. When complete, the architecture will look like this

## od4es.json

This is the root stack, that you deploy directly via the CloudFormation console. It contains links to the other stacks that will create a VPC, create a seed node for bootstrapping an ES 7 cluster, create master nodes, create data nodes, and create a client node with a private IP address.

## network.json

Deploys an [Amazon VPC](https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/) to provide secure networking for the Open Distro for Elasticsearch cluster. The VPC spans 3 availability zones, with a private subnet in each of those zones.

## seed.json

Deploys a single, seed instance at a known IP address that is the seed to bootstrap the Elasticsearch cluster.

## data-nodes.json

Deploys an auto scaled group of data nodes into the private subnet of the VPC

## master-nodes.json

Deploys an auto scaled group of master nodes. Initially it deploys 2 instances. The seed node remains in the cluster as the 3rd master.

## client-nodes.json

Deploys a single instance with a public IP address in the public subnet of the VPC. This instance joins the cluster as a client node. It also runs Kibana server.

# To use this stack

### Create an S3 bucket

\- Clone or download the repository.
\- Create an S3 bucket to hold the templates, in the region you want to deploy the stack.  You can use the AWS Console to create a bucket. Or, if you have [installed and configured the AWS Command Line Interface](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html), you can run the command  

```aws s3 mb <your bucket> --region <desired region>```

### Modify `od4es.json`, editing S3 bucket references

`od4es.json` has 5 `AWS::CloudFormation::Stack` resources. Each of these has an S3 location for the stack. For example, the seed node's stack is defined like this

```
        "Seed":{
            "Type": "AWS::CloudFormation::Stack",
            "Properties": {
                "TemplateURL": "https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/odfe-cfn/seed.json",
                "Parameters": {
                    "NetworkStackName" : { "Fn::GetAtt" : [ "Network", "Outputs.StackName" ] },
                    "KeyName" : {"Ref" : "KeyName"},
                    "MasterInstanceType": { "Ref": "MasterInstanceType" }
                }
            }
        }
```

Edit `od4es.json`, replacing the `TemplateURL`'s bucket `odfe-cfn` with the [region endpoint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html) and name of the bucket you created above.

### Put the templates in your bucket

\- Edit `package-to-s3.sh`, replacing the bucket name in the first line `bucket=_bucket_name_` with the bucket name from the bucket you created above. 
\- Make the script executable `chmod u+x package-to-s3.sh`
\- Run `./package-to-s3.sh` to send all the templates to your bucket.

### Create the stack

\- Navigate to the AWS CloudFormation console.
\- Click *Create Stack*
\- Use the S3 URL `https://s3-<region endpoint>.amazonaws.com/<your bucket>/od4es.json`
